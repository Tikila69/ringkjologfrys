# Getting started
## Installation of node.js
### npm
To use node packages you must install a node version manager that will install Node.js and npm. I recommend following this website: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
## Node Modules
### Install NPM packages
After you have installed node.js, nvm and npm you can type this into your terminal at the root of the backend folder:
npm install
### Scripts
After having installed the node modules you can run the following command at the root of the folder:

npm start

This will open a local server at your specified port. ( by default it is: http://localhost:3000 )
